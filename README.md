# arturomoncadatorres.github.io

This repository contains all the files needed for my personal website, [`arturomoncadatorres.com`](https://arturomoncadatorres.com/). It was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) and [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages), based on the Steve Jekyll theme by `jorok` (which unfortunately is no longer being offered nor supported by the creator).
