# arturomoncadatorres.github.io

This repository contains all the files needed for my personal website, [`arturomoncadatorres.com`](https://arturomoncadatorres.com/). It was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) and [Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages), based on the [Steve Jekyll](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/steve-a-minimal-blog-theme-for-jekyll) theme by `jorok`.

For a more detailed description of its technical setup, see the accompanying [instructions](./instructions.md).
