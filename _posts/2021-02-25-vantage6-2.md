I am very happy to share that we have officially released VANTAGE6 version 2.0! This time, we named it after a Japanese vantage point: Harukas.

Harukas is one of the tallest buildings in Osaka, with an altitude of 300 m. Its name comes from the old Japanese word "Êô¥„Çã„Åã„Åô" (harukasu), which can be roughly translated as "to brighten or to clear up". It hosts Japan's largest department store.

The new features of VANTAGE6 v2.0 (Harukas) include:

* Role-based access control
* Overhaul of the Python client (including management tools for the server)
* Implementation of `verbose` argument for server messages (very useful for debugging)
* A wide variety of CLI commands
* Better and more complete logging, including references to relevant documentation and Discord channel
* Several bug fixes

You can read more about them in VANTAGE6's official [release notes](https://docs.vantage6.ai/release-notes-1/2-harukas){: target="_blank"}.

Since such occasion couldn't go unnoticed, we organized a small [*borrel*](https://dutchreview.com/expat/work/borrelen/){: target="_blank"} (or celebratory drinks) with vantage6's core team. Given the circumstances, it was done virtually. However, that came with its own set of surprises:

  </tr>
  </table>

We wanted to make this a fun event. Thus, together with my friend and colleague Frank, we prepared a vantage-oriented quiz. If you want to test your knowledge, you can find it [here](https://vantage6.ai/documents/12/harukas_quiz.ppsx){: target="_blank"} (and the corresponding answers [here](https://vantage6.ai/documents/13/harukas_quiz_answers.ppsx){: target="_blank"}). The members of the winning team managed to take home a tasty present ü§§.

Lastly, I would like to close this post with the now-classic screen capture of the virtual event. I am very happy to work with such smart people in such a cool project.

Looking forward to VANTAGE6 v3.0!
