Recently, I was going through my undergraduate lecture notes. I stumbled uponÂ an exercise which I found interesting. The task consisted in implementing the algorithm proposed by Pei and Tseng, which uses vector projection to minimize the problem of transient values when applying an IIR notch filter to an ECG signal.

A complete, detailed explanation of it can be found in

> Pei, Soo-Chang, and Tseng, Chien-Cheng. ["Elimination of AC interference in electrocardiogram using IIR notch filter with transient suppression"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=469385){: target="_blank"}. Biomedical Engineering, IEEE Transactions on 42.11 (1995): 1128-1132.

I decided to implement it in MATLAB and in Python. You can find the submission in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/arturomoncadatorres/ecg-transient-suppression){: target="_blank"}, which includes sample ECG data (as a `.mat` file) as well as a main/demo file, which I suggest you to try in order to understand how it works. The scripts include plenty of comments in which I tried to explain each of the steps as clear as possible.
