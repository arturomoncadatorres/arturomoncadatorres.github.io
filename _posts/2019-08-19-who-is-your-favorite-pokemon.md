The newest entries of the Pok&eacute; main series, Pok&eacute;mon Sword and Pok&eacute;mon Shield will be released later this year. However, the new generation of pocket monsters came with the news that [you won't be able to complete the national Pok&eacute;dex](http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/you_cannot_have_a_complete_national_pokedex_in_pokemon_sword_and_shield). In other words, you won't be able to capture all the Pok&eacute;mon from previous 7 generations. In a series where "Gotta catch'em all" is its catch phrase, this caused a huge backslash by some members of the community. Their main argument was that "every Pok&eacute;mon is someone's favorite". Is this actually true?

In order to test this, reddit user `mamamia1001` created a survey to record Pok&eacute;mon preference [and made the dataset public](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c0w4s0/favourite_pok%C3%A9mon_survey_results/). In this project, I redid some of the original analysis (Pok&eacute;mon preference by generation, type, family, etc.) and generated  graphical visualizations of the results. I am also including some analysis on my own, such as voting trends in time and trying to find an explanation to what makes people prefer certain Pok&eacute;mon.
