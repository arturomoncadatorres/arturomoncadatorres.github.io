-------------

DeepSurvK was developed in [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/){: target="_blank"} (a fantastic open-source Python IDE) using [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter){: target="_blank"} and the [`arturomoncadatorres/cookiecutter-pypackage` project template](https://github.com/arturomoncadatorres/cookiecutter-pypackage){: target="_blank"}.

If there is a problem with the code (e.g., mistake), please [open an issue](https://github.com/arturomoncadatorres/deepsurvk/issues).
